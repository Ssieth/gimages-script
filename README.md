# Google Images Improver

This script is designed to add some extra functionality to google image search

It requires a userscript plugin for your browser.  I use TamperMonkey (https://www.tampermonkey.net/) but there are other alternatives.

The specific features are listed below:

## In the last version
0.1.0:

* Clicking images in the right side-bar now takes you straight to the image, not the page on which it is used.
* Link beneath the image on the right side-bar now goes direct rather than by a google url redirector
